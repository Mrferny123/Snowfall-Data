# Snowfall-Data
Explores snowfall data and relationships between snowfall inches and months for Alaska and Chicago in Deep Note by using mathplotlib. I made this for an assignment for my BWSI program. The notebook has some things the instructor wrote, but the exercises are what I wrote. Refined it so that there is both juypter notebook adn streamlit version

Since the library mathplotlib was new for me I struggled with it a little bit, but I was able to push on through and figure the syntax out.
It was also difficult for me to understand the new syntax of streamlit and how to convert.
